Monday, March 4, 2025- During my first day at the City of Refuge's Cybersecurity training class, we were able to become acquainted with the COR staff and facility and learn more about the origin, mission and vision of the program. We were introduced to some amazing people who were very interesting as well as networking with our classmates, which brought a sense of belonging to be around like-minded individuals. We performed group activities, and got to know our classmates through an interesting ice breaker of writing down two lies and one truth about ourselves and the class guessing which one is true or not. The first day was a great day.














Monday, March 24, 2025- Today we started class with a review of binary computer language from nible and bits to ASCII and Unicode. This discussion then led into a more in-depth learning of networking fundamentals. After converting dotted decimals numbers to binary numbers and vice versa, we learned about the OSI Model and how it differs from the TCIP model. A cool way to memorize the layers of the OSI Model was mentioned by our TA, J.W.: Please Do Not Trash my Sausage Pizza Away. Which is the mnemonic phrase for Physical, Datalink, Network, Transport, Session, Preparation, Application, the seven layers of the OSI Model. 
Tuesday, March 25, 2025- We started class with a review of IPv4 class ranges and how they break into the private IP addresses. 
Wednesday, March 26, 2025- Today was an incredible day filled with an incredible experience. Let's talk about it: Our day started at Cox Enterprise, a privately-owned, multi-billion dollar tech company. Here, we toured the jobplace campus to include the Cox Automotive building, their courtyard, the cafeteria(for lunch, of course), an employee lounge area and levels one and nine to view the tech support and cybersecurity workspaces. Our wonderful tour guide was the eloustrious Hadji, who was also kind enough to show us his personal office on the ninth floor AND pay for half the crews' lunches, alongside our other host/sponsor, Gabriel. We learned all about the history of Cox Enterprise, which started in Ohio by governor, James M. Cox. His great- grandson, Alex Taylor, is Cox' current CEO.
Thursday, March 27, 2025- After our review of the information we learned on Tuesday, Mr. Darryl went straight into our learning  for today to include the differences between ping(test), tcpdump(commandline only) and traceroute(hop). We completed a successful installation of Apache2 webserver, then typed the ip into Microsoft Edge and was able to see the gui version of what we completed in Ubuntu. Derrick then showed us how to download another website that we will explore more of tomorrow. 

Monday, March 31, 2025- Today is the day of the test. Today's test determines whether we continue in this program or not. It is hard not to feel the anxiousness in the room at this time- everyone is on edge! We find out later today if we pass or not. Wish me luck!
