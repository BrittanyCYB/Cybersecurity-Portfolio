Monday, March 4, 2025- During my first day at the City of Refuge's Cybersecurity training class, we were able to become acquainted with the COR staff and facility and learn more about the origin, mission and vision of the program. We were introduced to some amazing people who were very interesting as well as networking with our classmates, which brought a sense of belonging to be around like-minded individuals. We performed group activities, and got to know our classmates through an interesting ice breaker of writing down two lies and one truth about ourselves and the class guessing which one is true or not. The first day was a great day.














Monday, March 24, 2025- Today we started class with a review of binary computer language from nible and bits to ASCII and Unicode. This discussion then led into a more in-depth learning of networking fundamentals. After converting dotted decimals numbers to binary numbers and vice versa, we learned about the OSI Model and how it differs from the TCIP model. A cool way to memorize the layers of the OSI Model was mentioned by our TA, J.W.: Please Do Not Trash my Sausage Pizza Away. Which is the mnemonic phrase for Physical, Datalink, Network, Transport, Session, Preparation, Application, the seven layers of the OSI Model. 
Tuesday, March 25, 2025- We started class with a review of IPv4 class ranges and how they break into the private IP addresses. 
Wednesday, March 26, 2025- Today was an incredible day filled with an incredible experience. Let's talk about it: Our day started at Cox Enterprise, a privately-owned, multi-billion dollar tech company. Here, we toured the jobplace campus to include the Cox Automotive building, their courtyard, the cafeteria(for lunch, of course), an employee lounge area and levels one and nine to view the tech support and cybersecurity workspaces. Our wonderful tour guide was the eloustrious Hadji, who was also kind enough to show us his personal office on the ninth floor AND pay for half the crews' lunches, alongside our other host/sponsor, Gabriel. We learned all about the history of Cox Enterprise, which started in Ohio by governor, James M. Cox. His great- grandson, Alex Taylor, is Cox' current CEO.
Thursday, March 27, 2025- After our review of the information we learned on Tuesday, Mr. Darryl went straight into our learning  for today to include the differences between ping(test), tcpdump(commandline only) and traceroute(hop). We completed a successful installation of Apache2 webserver, then typed the ip into Microsoft Edge and was able to see the gui version of what we completed in Ubuntu. Derrick then showed us how to download another website that we will explore more of tomorrow.

Monday, March 31, 2025- Today is the day of the test. Today's test determines whether we continue in this program or not. It is hard not to feel the anxiousness in the room at this time- everyone is on edge! We find out later today if we pass or not. Wish me luck!
Tuesday, April 1, 2025- God has been so good to me. I made it past the first 30 days of the City of Refuge's Cybersecurity course. Despite the overwhelming, debilitating feeling that overcomes me during this period of grief for me, I was informed that I could continue onto the next level of the course and enter into the full networking course. I am overwhelmed with so many different feelings during this difficult time of the year for me. Learning networking topologies and OSI model concepts with Mr. Darryl today keeps my mind focused on the "main thing". 
Wednesday, April 2, 2025- We were visited by Ron Cofield and Craig Baltes, the Director of Information Services at Aflac. Ron requested us to write three positive and two negative things about ourselves as it relates to our enneagram results. Then, we performed an exercise where we wrote about ourselves from the view of a coworker giving a speech at our retirement party. We were to look into which positions we should have based on our enneagram type and write the story as if we had already acheived that dream position. Afterwards, we heard from Craig, who gave us a look into his personal life and how he was able to get to the place he is now in his career. He was also kind enough to answer the questions we asked regarding Aflac's current and past procedures.
Thursday, April 3, 2025- Mr. Darryl discussed the physical layer of the OSI model which deals with wired and wireless transmitions of binary. Under the wired category, there are three wired cables: twisted cable, coaxial, and fiber optic. Under the wireless category, there is analog. It was interesting to see how all forms of wirless communication have been used for years now, and I am just now having a better understanding of each component and how they all work together or apart to produce the same ultimate result. 
Friday, April 4, 2025- Today, we participated in NPursuit's AI in the A day where we assisted the founder and CEO of NPursuit, Jahari, in conducting three discussions about AI as it pertains to business, resume writing and one other class. I was the time-keeper throughout the resume writing class that was hosted by Primous Howard. In his class, he talked about a number of ways to use a multitude of AI websites in efforts to ensure your resume gets you the job you desire. The first website being the most commonly used site, Chat GPT. On this site, Primous gave examples of how we can prompt Chat GPT to create the proper verbage on our resumes. Then, go to the next AI based website, Gamma, to create a visual presentation based on the information in your resume. This presentation gives a visual aspect to the information in your resume with vivid color details. We then visited another website that allowed you to practice interview questions based on the job description of your choice. This was a great way to practice answering the most common and not-so-common interview questions to its fullest extent as we sometimes don't. This was a great overall experience to see and connect with people in our community who are also interested in the current advancements in AI as we are.
