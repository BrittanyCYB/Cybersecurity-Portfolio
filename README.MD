#ðŸ’– About Me  **Name:** [Brittany B]   
**ðŸ’–Hometown:** [Atlanta, Georgia]    
**ðŸ’–Prior IT Experience:** [While my prior work experience is in healthcare, I have used most aspects of IT throughout the majority of my work history. 
My interests for working in IT came from the realization that technology is at the core of almost everything we do today. Watching how data breaches and 
cyberattacks made headlines, affecting everything from hospitals to large corporations.The idea of being part of the solution, of safegaurding these 
digital spaces, excites me.]    
**ðŸ’–Career Plans:**  [Long term, I aspire to attain my CISSP certification and lead teams of specialized individuals in threat analysis or security architechture]  
**ðŸ’–Proud Project/Task:**   
[An experience that I am most proud of is having the courage to walk away from a career I thought I would spend the rest of my life doing, to pursue 
a completely different career. To be stepping out on faith and completing a completely new and challenging field with only a little prior knowledge/experience 
makes me proud that I am doing something that would scare most people. While I am nervous and a bit fearful, I am most proud of myself for challenging myself to 
rise above those feelings for the greater goal of becoming a Cybersecurity professional.]
