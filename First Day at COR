Monday, March 4, 2025- During my first day at the City of Refuge's Cybersecurity training class, we were able to become acquainted with the COR staff and facility and learn more about the origin, mission and vision of the program. We were introduced to some amazing people who were very interesting as well as networking with our classmates, which brought a sense of belonging to be around like-minded individuals. We performed group activities, and got to know our classmates through an interesting ice breaker of writing down two lies and one truth about ourselves and the class guessing which one is true or not. The first day was a great day.














Monday, March 24, 2025- Today we started class with a review of binary computer language from nible and bits to ASCII and Unicode. This discussion then led into a more in-depth learning of networking fundamentals. After converting dotted decimals numbers to binary numbers and vice versa, we learned about the OSI Model and how it differs from the TCIP model. A cool way to memorize the layers of the OSI Model was mentioned by our TA, J.W.: Please Do Not Trash my Sausage Pizza Away. Which is the mnemonic phrase for Physical, Datalink, Network, Transport, Session, Preparation, Application, the seven layers of the OSI Model.
