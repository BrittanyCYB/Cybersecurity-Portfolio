2025/03/04- During my first day at the City of Refuge's Cybersecurity training class, we were able to become acquainted with the COR staff and facility and learn more about the origin, mission and vision of the program. We were introduced to some amazing people who were very interesting as well as networking with our classmates, which brought a sense of belonging to be around like-minded individuals. We performed group activities, and got to know our classmates through an interesting ice breaker of writing down two lies and one truth about ourselves and the class guessing which one is true or not. The first day was a great day.
